In the day 1 I have learn about the basic of java and made the program of some problems based on { accessing variables outside main method,variables and data types,switch case statement in java,area of shapes by taking input from user,Taking input from user }.

The problems of the java are as following:-

Q1. Accessing Variables Outside the Main Method Create a class with one static variable and one non-static variable. Access and print both variables inside the main method (using static keyword and object creation).

Q2. Java Variables & Data Types Declare variables of different data types: int, float, double, char, boolean. Print their values and observe the outputs.

Q3. Switch Case Statement o Take the day number (1 to 7) as input from the user. o Use switch-case to print the name of the day. (Example: 1 -> Monday, 2 -> Tuesday, ..., 7 -> Sunday)

Q4. Calculate the Area of Rectangle (Take input from user) o Use Scanner class to take length and breadth as input from the user. o Calculate and print the area of the rectangle.
